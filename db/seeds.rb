# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  user = User.create(email: 'plingaiah@qwinix.io' , password: 'Qwinix123' , password_confirmation: 'Qwinix123' )
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
